Use of G4Root, VGM, Geant4 G3toG4, UI and VIS packages in Geant4 VMC library is optional and can be switched on/off during CMake build.
Overview of available options and their default values:

See below tips for configuration and installation of these packages.
The path to required and optional packages installations can be defined in the standard CMake way, via the paths to the CMake configuration file:
Geant4_DIR ... path to Geant4Config.cmake ROOT_DIR ... path to ROOTConfig.</description></item></channel></rss>
