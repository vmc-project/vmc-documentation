### Chapter 3.4

# G4Root

The G4Root package is an interface allowing running a GEANT4 simulation with a ROOT geometry. In fact it is just the G4 navigation that uses directly the TGeo geometry. 
Though it is distributed in **geant4_vmc**, it can be built and used independently from VMC.

See more details on the [G4Root](http://ivana.home.cern.ch/ivana/g4root_html) </a> web page.
