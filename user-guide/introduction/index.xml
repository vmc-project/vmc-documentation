The core of the VMC is the category of classes vmc. It provides a set of interfaces which completely decouple the dependencies between the user code and the concrete Monte Carlo, two of which have the key role:</description></item><item><title>VMC Project</title><link>https://vmc-project.github.io/user-guide/introduction/vmc-project/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vmc-project.github.io/user-guide/introduction/vmc-project/</guid><description>The vmc-project GitGub organization provides the following packages:
vmc -&amp;gt; The core of the VMC provides the interfaces and classes independent from the Monte Carlo transport code.
See more in the VMC Core section.
geant3 -&amp;gt; The updated version of Geant3.21 that includes several bug fixes compared to the standard version in CERNLIB. The directory TGeant3 contains the classes which implement the TVirtualMC interface for Geant3
